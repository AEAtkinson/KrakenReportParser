# KrakenReportParser
Kraken Oncogenic Virus compiler.  Creates a sorted genotype specific file obtained from Kraken k-mer counts obtained from a custom databasecontaining
only oncogenic viruses: HPV (high and low risk genotypes) EBV, CMV, HBV, BKV, HTLV1 as well as Malassezia globosa. Sequences were also limited either to specific ORFs or 16s in order to be more comparable to clinical testing and reduce repetitive sequence beyond what is produce with masked whoel genomes.
